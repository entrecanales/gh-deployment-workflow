Hi
The goal of this project is so I get more exp with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.
That's kind of it, really.
This is the project link: 
https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow

The changes to index.html will reflect in my own GitHub Page:
https://entrecanales.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/

To edit the conditions (so the page is deployed when this file is edited for instance), check the deploy.yml at .github/workflow.
